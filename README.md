# Copy Address To Clipboard And Title (CATCAT)

Copy Address To Clipboard And Title (CATCAT) is a Firefox add-on that lets you right click on any web page and copy its title and URL into your clipboard.

Why would you want to use this add-on? While there are plenty of URLs that provide enough of a "slug" to understand the content of the URL, there are many examples of URLs that are completely opaque, containing only numbers, such as Twitter posts and GitHub issues. With CATCAT, you can send someone a meaningful title along with a URL.

CATCAT is a partial replacement for CoLT, which does not run on Firefox 57+ per https://github.com/jgbishop/colt/issues/16

CATCAT was heavily influenced by the "Copy Link Text" add-on at https://github.com/def00111/copy-link-text
